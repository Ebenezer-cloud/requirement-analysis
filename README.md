# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis: is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting** the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system.
It helps ensure that the software developed will meet user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility.

In simpler terms, it’s the foundation phase where developers and clients agree on *what the system should do* before any actual coding begins.

  *Purpose of Requirement Analysis*

The main goal of requirement analysis is to ensure that:

* The software project has **clear, complete, and accurate requirements**.
* There is a **common understanding** between developers, clients, and users.
* The final product will **satisfy user needs** and function as expected.


  *Steps Involved in Requirement Analysis*

1.  *Requirement Gathering*

   * Collect information from users, clients, and stakeholders.
   * Techniques include interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, observations, and document analysis.

2.  *Requirement Elicitation*

   * Clarify and refine the gathered information to understand what users truly need (not just what they say they want).
   * Example: Discussing use cases and workflows to uncover hidden or implicit needs.

3.  *Requirement Analysis and Modeling*

   * Examine the collected data to detect conflicts, redundancies, or feasibility issues.
   * Create models such as data flow diagrams (DFD), use case diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) to visualize requirements.

4.  *Requirement Specification*

   * Document all approved requirements clearly and systematically in a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.
   * This serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders and the development team.

5.  *Requirement Validation*

   * Verify that all requirements are correct, complete, consistent, and aligned with business objectives.
   * Conduct reviews, walkthroughs, and prototypes to confirm understanding.

6.  *Requirement Management*

   * Track, update, and manage changes to requirements throughout the project’s lifecycle.
   * Prevents scope creep and ensures version control.

  *Types of Requirements*

1. *Functional Requirements:*

   * Define *what* the system should do.
   * Example: “The system should allow users to log in using an email and password.”

2. *Non-Functional Requirements:*

   * Define *how* the system performs.
   * Example: “The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.”

3. *User Requirements:*

   * Expressed in natural language from the end user’s perspective.
   * Example: “Teachers should be able to upload student grades easily.”

4. *System Requirements:*

   * Technical and detailed specifications that guide developers.
   * Example: “The database must support 10,000 concurrent users.”

  *Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC*

Requirement Analysis plays a **crucial role** in every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

| **SDLC Phase**                 | **How Requirement Analysis Helps**                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Planning**                | Provides a clear understanding of the project scope, time, and cost estimation.         |
| **2. Design**                  | Guides system architecture, database, and user interface design based on defined needs. |
| **3. Implementation (Coding)** | Acts as a blueprint for developers to follow when writing code.                         |
| **4. Testing**                 | Helps testers design test cases based on specified requirements.                        |
| **5. Deployment**              | Ensures the system delivered aligns with what the client requested.                     |
| **6. Maintenance**             | Makes it easier to manage changes and updates by referring to documented requirements.  |

*Why Requirement Analysis Is Important*

1. *Prevents Miscommunication:*
   Ensures all stakeholders share the same understanding of the project goals.

2. *Reduces Rework and Costs:*
   Fixing issues at the requirement stage is cheaper than after development.

3. *Improves Quality:*
   Leads to building software that truly satisfies user needs.

4. *Saves Time:*
   A clear plan prevents confusion and delays during later stages.

5. *Ensures Project Success:*
   Most software project failures result from poor or incomplete requirement analysis.

*Example*

Imagine developing a **school management system**:

* If requirements are not clearly defined, developers might build a student attendance module while the school actually needed a grade reporting system.
* Proper requirement analysis ensures that every feature—attendance tracking, grading, or fee payment—is clearly defined, understood, and implemented correctly.
